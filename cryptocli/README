How CryptoCLI is built?
----------------------

The source of our CryptoCLI can be found at vaultcli/cryptocli in htdc repo.

The Makefile at cryptocli/Makefile does the following,

1. Creates a temporary Go workspace at vaultcli/cryptocli-build
2. Copies all required files and packages from vaultcli to vaultcli/cryptocli and copies the soucre code to the src/ directory of tmp workspace(vaultcli/cryptocli-build). 
3. Run commands to create go mod and go sums files to download required packages.
4. Required Linux & Windows binaries are compiled & built at vaultcli/cryptocli-build/bin directory. Note that these for amd64 architecture systems.
