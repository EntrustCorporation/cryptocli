# cryptocli

cryptocli is a command line tool to manage, control and access KeyControl Tokenization Vault. 

The KeyControl Tokenization Vault provides centralized mechanism to create and manage cryptographic keys and utilize those keys to encrypt, decrypt, tokenize, detokenize, sign, verify, wrap and unwrap data. 

cryptocli requires Entrust KeyControl version 10.2 or later. 

A Tokenization Vault must be created by the KeyControl Security Administrator. 

Both Tokenization Vault Users and Administrators can access secrets using the cryptocli with the login URL. 

Access to certain commands can be restricted using tokenization permissions from access policies.
